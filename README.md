# 🏥 NFT Appointment Tickets for Clinics

## 📘 Project Description

This project is a smart contract written in the Move language for the Aptos blockchain. It enables clinics to mint NFT-based appointment tickets and allows patients to book appointments by claiming those NFTs. Each appointment slot is represented by a unique, non-transferable token, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and reliability.

The contract consists of two primary functions:

1. `create_ticket`: Enables a clinic to create an appointment ticket in the form of an NFT.
2. `book_appointment`: Allows a patient to book an appointment by claiming the NFT ticket.

## 🎯 Project Vision

In a world where healthcare is moving rapidly toward digitization, this project envisions a blockchain-powered appointment system that offers:

- Trustless interaction between clinics and patients.
- Transparent and immutable appointment booking.
- Real-world utility for NFTs in the healthcare domain.
- A foundation for decentralized health service infrastructure.

## 🔮 Future Scope

This basic contract sets the groundwork for a larger, more complex ecosystem. Future enhancements may include:

- Support for multiple time slots and automatic scheduling.
- Role-based access (admin, clinic, patient).
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems for secure patient verification.
- Notification systems for booked/canceled appointments.
- A user-friendly frontend interface or mobile app.
- Payment gateways using Aptos coins or stablecoins for booking fees.
